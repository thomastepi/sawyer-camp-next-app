The incident resulted in the tragic loss of approximately 8,000 cones of oil palm and critically important machinery used for processing palm fruits into palm oil. The financial damage is estimated at around 7 million francs CFA, marking a significant setback for the community-focused union that has tirelessly worked to empower local farmers and fortify the region's agricultural prowess.",
